                    <h1>My First Impression Of Joining<br/>The Jobready Web Development Bootcamp</h1>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>I was able to join this jobready web development bootcamp because I got a scholarship for winning the Samsung Innovation Campus bootcamp last year. This bootcamp started when I just graduated from vocational school. This bootcamp starts from August to December 2023. Right now my daily life is only focused on this bootcamp.</p>
                    <p>This bootcamp begins with doing individual HTML, CSS, and Javacript material exercises. Then the participants including me were grouped into 5 groups of 3 people each. Once I found new groups and friends, we were given the task of creating digital ideas and solutions. Then create an app that can be used by everyone</p>
                    <p>My first impression of attending this bootcamp was to feel nervous and scared because I met other friends who might be better at programming. But I am happy to have the opportunity to make new friends who come from out of town and also have the opportunity to get guidance from a very great new mentor.</p>
                    <p>I am currently in the learning process and starting to find difficulties because I am learning higher than the previous bootcamp. But I will try to learn better so that I can gain more knowledge than before.</p>
