                    <h1>My Experience In Carrying Out Field Work Practice</h1>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>I started doing fieldwork practice in August 2022, precisely when I was in grade 4. I along with 3 of my classmates carried out street vendors in the same place, namely PT Granitor System APAC. At first I was disappointed because I was placed in a company that had a different field from my major, namely engineering, electronics, power and communications. I do more administrative matters than practice, because the company does not allow female students to go to the field. So I often see my male friends when I am practicing at the company.</p>
                    <p>During my 6 months of fieldwork practice at the company, I knew a lot of new things outside our major. In addition to being a positive thing for me, but of course there are difficulties for me when trying to understand the material and practice that I have just heard. In addition to material and practice, in the company we are required to be able to be public speacing and speak English. Because every Friday is the company's routine to attract 1 person to make a presentation in English in front of all employees.</p>
                    <p>Another difficulty I felt when I started working on the final report of the results of fieldwork practice. Because I am in a company with a different field from my major, so I have to make a report with material outside the subject of the major. Moreover, as a student, I do more administrative matters, so I have to ask more of my male friends and employees there.</p>
                    <p>However, in any case, my practical fieldwork experience in the company was valuable for me. Starting from the material and practices that I just knew to the administrative matters that I had worked on, as well as the ability of public speaking and language skills, these knowledge will be useful for me in the future. </p>
